            "> engineers who've worked with them (or reviewed their OSS contributions) could validate or challenge that [skill] I like your idea of verifiable skills but I don’t think the proposal is solid. We need a trusted third-party as a validator so everyone is happy. Otherwise, we bring bias and corruption into this. The problem is currently solved by professional certification — yes it could be gamed but it provides an official confirmation from a reputable source rather than someone’s word that you’re good. Please keep iterating! We need better tools!",
            "As a hiring manager know what you want and be careful what you communicate to determine your desired audience. Secondly, skill verification is a form of leaky abstraction and may not be what hiring managers want. It’s most often not about finding the most skilled candidate but rather the most compatible candidate. This can commonly mean finding the least sucky person from a pool of sucky people. Hiring managers can game that by setting requirements criteria for a job. If you want extremely skilled people then get down to the metal and find candidates that like to work without tools or abstractions. If you super versatile candidates find people with experience in a bazillion different tools. ",
            "The idea is great, but everything else is not. A few points: - You say \"engineering\" verification, I checked and it's all computer science, monkey coding, full stack whatever, not only is that NOT engineering, it wasn't before generative AI, and it's definitely not now. This is programming. Programming is writing, and with AI it's more of storytelling rather than engineering. - How would this platform measure real engineering skills? Critical thinking, problem solving, etc.? What about Electrical Engineering? Civil Engineering? Robotics design? Etc. - I didn't open an account, but on the first page it asks for LinkedIn.. really? I don't trust most of what I read there. GitHub? Not only does ",
            "The model gets interesting if reviewer credibility is scored by calibration over time, not follower count. Without that, it will drift toward reciprocal endorsements and people gaming each other’s profiles.",
            "Congratulations, you have just reinvented a feature that LinkedIn has had for years and not solved how easily it can be gamed. And honestly, validating skills like that is strictly something a mid level (no matter what your title is) “engineer” would do. Every interview I have had since 2014 - and I have had 5 since then including three as a strategic hire (still hands on keyboard) by a new to the company director/CTO and one at BigTech and now full time staff consultant (cloud + app dev) has been behavioral where I had to convince then that I was “smart and gets things done”. No matter what generic set of skills you have Kubernetes, AWS, etc, everyone and their dog have those skills - or at",
            "Thank you for the feedback, I appriciate it. The idea is to avoid the corruption and bias by hand picking a starter deck of super trusted few professionals who would be able to verify others. For example to prove someone is an senior engineer from google I can ask for a pay slip and references and yes certifications, so we would become that rusted partner. Still working on the proposal and iterations, I wanna talk to much engineers, hiring manages as possible since this is going to be for everyone, to navigate this wild job market. We definitely need better tools, at the moment it is wild that it takes 1000 of applications to just get an answer from any company, this not right at all",
            "This is a real insight \"finding the most skilled candidate but rather the most compatible candidate\", thank you very much, this is the kind of feedback I am looking for from engineers. I never looked at it from this perspective. I talked to hiring managers and most of them say skills is good but what we want is a personality because skills can be taught and personality cannot be. Personality I have experienced that, very skilled teammate exceptional, but personality was not a fit, so the management was not happy. \"The best way to determine the right candidate is to ignore the nonsense on their resume and just talk to people.\", that is true and this I have tried with when I was playing the ro",

Critical thinking, problem solving, etc.? What about Electrical Engineering? Civil Engineering? Robotics design? Etc - This will be all up to the hand picked person to measure your skills, for example the verifier will be assessing everything required to determine if someone is really good or not, that includes critical thinking, problem solving so on. Let's say this verifier they work/ed for Google, they will bring Google's interview framework t",
            "Endorsements are good way, but limited and they can be bought and can be faked easily, which does not bring much credibility.Do you think there is a way to improve the endorsement system from LinkedIn into something that will be taken more seriously? Yes that is the main assumption, seniors would not be interested in getting their skill verified they will be doing the verifying to a junior or whatever entry title there is, in order to help them gain their credibility even mentor them, so it would be easier for them to stand out. That is a fair point, also that is going to be part of the verification process, engineers would be able to get badges verified for their projects, atm I can AI gene",

That is correct, but its an extreme over simplification. What they mean by personality is among these: * excellent soft skills - can listen and emotionally bond with others * excellent written communication - the ability to put into writing high precision content with minimal revision that is well structured. It should not take advanced effort to turn meeting notes into a formal written recommendation. * discipline / conscientiousness - this is awareness of the space outside yourself.
