People will continue using AI but when the AI bubble pops, sooner than later, things will stabilize and adapt to real usage with a different business model.

It will allow the \"real\" users to continue having access to it and sieve out the ones who are just playing around. Prices for RAM, GPUs, SSDs will normalize a lot and more people will move towards local models.

If the AI tool companies increase their rates 2x, 5x, 10x, is it worth it? They aren't going to lower prices. Consumer AI tool usage isn't going to get a lot of adopters that will pay, people outside of a work environment will see it as a fun toy, much like social media and will be fine with being served ads and letting their loss of privacy b",

I agree it is depressing: there are quite a few people banging this drum and because of that it becomes harder to be heard. They, like AI have the advantage of quantity.

Most of these vibe coded projects just have very bad architecture and the experienced humans still have to review and clean it all up. Meanwhile, \"AGI\" is being promised by those big labs, but their actions says otherwise as what it really means is an IPO. After that, we will see a crash come afterwards and the hype brigade and all the vibe coders will be raced to zero by local models and will move on after the grift has concluded. You n",
            "Hi, I’ve been working with embedded Linux for 18 years. I’ve been actively trying to apply AI to our field, but the friction is real. We require determinism, whereas AI fundamentally operates on probability. The issue is the Pareto Principle in overdrive: AI gets you to 90% instantly, but in our environment, anything less than 100% is often a failure. Bridging that final 10% reliability gap is the real challenge. Still, I view total replacement as inevitable. We are currently in a transition period where our job is to rigorously experiment and figure out how to safely cross that gap. Good luck!",

Psychologically, the part that seems depressing is that everything just seems totally disposable now. It's hard to even see the point of learning the latest and greatest AI tools/models, because they'll be replaced in about 3 months, and it's hard to see the point in trying to build anything with, or without AI, given the deluge of AI slop it will be up against.

I do not fear that some agents will pollute my repos with their PR. In opposite, I suppose that we will end at a point where for each question, task, or problem, one will find many (AI-coded) solutions, making it impossible to choose a right, solid, reliable one. I recently thought about having a database of tools per task so that a comparison would be possible. But the maintenance costs of something like this are enormous when including benchmarks, comparisons, etc. on different qualities.",

If you aren't reading LinkedIn or HN, how much do you actually hear about AI in day-to-day life? If someone at work directly asks you to do something using AI, you might make some effort to do it. But otherwise let the news and hype cycle play out. You don't need to anticipate or keep abreast of where people think things will be in ten years... they are almost certainly wrong. Think of LinkedIn and HN as entertainment at best. Work on personal coding projects without AI, build relationships with non-tech people, go outside."
